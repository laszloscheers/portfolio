    "little_town_description": "This website aims to enhance the visits to a pretended small village called Little Town. Potential visitors to the town can take a look at the beauty spots, restaurants, pubs, and accommodations. It also aims to be a place to connect for the town's inhabitants, where local business owners can publish their services to the portal, the town's undergoing and upcoming projects are shown, and a forum to post and comment posts. This is the final project for the Higher Diploma in Web Development (NCI Dublin). It is a Ruby on Rails web application, uses the gem Devise to manage user's accounts, Outlook smtp to send mails, Google Cloud Storage and Rails Active Storage to store the images that business owners publish, and it is deployed in fly.io (a host that manages RoR apps and Postgre databases).",
